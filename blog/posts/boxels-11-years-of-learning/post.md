It's taken me a lot of personal development to get to the point where I could
even finish something I'd call a "game". Boxels is not that. Other than walking
around, there is nothing to iteract with in the gameworld.

For the longest time I worked on "games" only to the point of seeing something
on screen or achieving a particular technical accomplishment and I would table
the project for later.

I created boxels in 13 day's time working in the evenings and weekends for a
total of approximately 30 hours of work.

3D audio took me almost an entire day.
Physics took me an entire day.
Networking took me 3 days and I rewrote it 3 times.
I tried 2 different networking techniques to no avail: a
public rendezvous server for NAT Punchthrough and using TCP and UDP together.

Wire protocol vs message protocol.
