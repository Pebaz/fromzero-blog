## Introduction

![Boxel Screenshot](../static/img/boxels/boxels-screenshot-3.png)

It's taken me a lot of personal development to get to the point where I could
even finish something I'd call a "game". Boxels is not that. Other than walking
around, there is nothing to iteract with in the gameworld. Instead, I would
consider this project to be an extensible base upon which to build more
functionality later. For instance, the barebones entity system can be extended
to support picking up items or adding vegetation to the world.

For the longest time I worked on "games" only to the point of seeing something
on screen or achieving a particular technical accomplishment and I would table
the project for later. Over time, there were so many projects like this that it
became a personal mission to finish as many projects as possible. I went back
and finished several in-progress projects and went on to start and then finish
many more. I became hungry for "checkboxes" as I used to think of them. As the
years went by I noticed that very few of my finished projects were games. After
all the time I spent learning about games and game technology, this did not feel
great. I felt I needed to have something to show for the knowledge I accumulated
about games in the 11 years I've been programming.

I was ready for a change and decided that this would be my last "from-scratch"
(as in, without a game engine) game I would do by myself. I set out to make a
multiplayer experience with simple cuboid walls and billboard sprites.

## The Design of Boxels
- Defining Boxels: Pixels, Voxels, Bloxels, and Boxels
- High-Level Game Design

Boxels refer to a nomenclature I have developed over the years:

* Pixels: containers for a specific color in a 2D image
* Voxels: volumetric pixels
* Bloxels: isometric 2.5D voxel sprites
* Boxels: textured cubes large enough for one game entity to stand in

The design of the game involved a client that handles player input, sound,
resource loading, and graphics, and a server that would handle the gameworld
simulation with physics, player -> entity tracking, and map generation.

## Development Timeline

I created boxels in 15 day's time working in the evenings and weekends for a
total of approximately 30 hours of work on 12 separate days.

3D audio took me almost an entire day.
Physics took me an entire day.
Networking took me 3 days and I rewrote it 3 times.
I tried 2 different networking techniques to no avail: a
public rendezvous server for NAT Punchthrough and using TCP and UDP together.

Wire protocol vs message protocol.

I rapid prototyped the project using [Kenny's](https://kenney.nl/) free assets.
This helped make the beginning of the project more enjoyable as there was
something to render on screen from day one.

## Technical Components
- Tools and Libraries Used
- Python, Raylib, and more
- From-scratch TCP socket networking
- By-hand 3D audio
- Use of ChatGPT as a coding assistant

**Libraries Used:**

Although I didn't use a game engine, I did make use of the extensive ecosystem
of quality libraries in the Python community. By being selective about what
libraries I used, I was able to maintain full control over the architecture of
the game and could decide when and where to implement something myself. One
example of this is 3D audio. I ended up using basic panning to make it sound as
if a sound was 3D because it turns out that distributing OpenAL with an
application is more difficult than it should be. Here's a list of libraries I
used:

* [**Raylib**](https://github.com/electronstudio/raylib-python-cffi):
    cross-platform windowing, rendering API, mouse/keyboard/gamepad input,
    audio/spatial audio, timing/game loop, texture/audio/mesh loading
* [**Flexible Collision Library**](https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/python-fcl):
    collision detection & response
* [**Pydantic**](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.0/): data modeling and validation,
    event format
* [**MessagePack**](https://msgpack.org/index.html) JSON compression, wire
    format
* [**MeowHash Python**](https://github.com/pebaz/meowhash-python): I wrote
    Python bindings to Casey Muratori's MeowHash library
* [**Nuitka**](https://nuitka.net/): compile Python project to executable, walk
    dependency tree and bundle C extensions

**Project Size**

The entire game is **1578** lines of Python code (2158 if you include comments
and whitespace). This is an astonishing number because this is a 3D multiplayer
experience, not a command line application. People really seem to underestimate
Python. Sometimes for good reason, other times it just baffles me how hard some
tasks are in other languages when I've seen good designs that have existed in
Python for years before being adopted elsewhere.

## Challenges Encountered

- There is no cross-platform way to get the MTU in any language: originally, I
    was planning on using 2 sockets: TCP for reliable messaging and UDP for
    quick frame-by-frame updates. It didn't matter if packets were lost for UDP
    since entity positions need to be replaced by the most recent packet anyway.

    However, this was kind of a ridiculous journey. TCP went fine, but with UDP,
    you can only send a maximum data payload of Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU).
    There are implications if you send more than MTU and they are
    non-deterministic to the programmer because they rely on the user's
    networking infrastructure and everything in between. The thing is, there's
    no built-in way to get the MTU in any programming language I know of. You
    have to make an operating system call or invoke a Linux-only networking
    command to get it. ðŸ¤¦ I abandoned using both TCP & UDP together since I
    didn't want to just pick a packet size and roll with it only to get a
    substantial test ready on another machine and experience crazy networking
    issues.

- NAT Punchthrough is not 100% reliable, especially not with VPNs in between:
    Only after I had created a rendezvous server as well as the client and
    server code to test it did I come across this. I wasted an entire day. NAT
    punchthrough is when you make a separate request to a public intermediary
    server between 2 hosts (client & server) where the client gets the server's
    IP address. The client then sends another request saying it wants to join
    that specific server. The server polls the rendezvous server and finds a
    player wanting to connect along with their IP address obtained from the
    join request. The server immediately starts sending UDP packets containing
    anything to the client's IP address. Meanwhile, the client has already
    gotten the server's IP address from the rendezvous server and immediately
    starts sending arbitrary UDP packets to it.

    Up until this point, no packets have successfully gotten from the client to
    the server or from the server to the client. This is because the server was
    sending packets that were dropped by the client's router since the client is
    protected by NAT. If the client started sending UDP packets first, they
    would not have been reciprocated until the server received the join request
    from the rendezvous server.

    It's complicated! At this point, there's 2 hosts beaming packets towards
    each other in the hopes that the client's router will first see the client's
    UDP packet as a request and the server's UDP packet as a response. If this
    happens, packets finally "punch through" the NAT and data can flow freely
    back and forth over that one socket. Getting this to work with TCP requires
    the same gymnastics but without the ability to easily send bogus data like
    with UDP.

    I gave up on this particular design for multiplayer (peer-to-peer) because
    of how unreliable it would be if a player had a VPN or if anything else got
    in the way.

- Multiplayer networking is an entirely separate project at least the size of
    the game client. Every networking project I do, I tell myself this at the
    end. Every time I start a new networking project, I forget that ever
    happened. *Networking is difficult and will take at least half of your
    time.* This includes considerations about simulating the gameworld as well
    as what the event system should look like. Don't underestimate how long it
    will take. It's not a 1:1. A single player game is complexity 1 and a
    networked multiplayer game is complexity 3 at least.

- Wire protocol is different than message protocol: I don't know why I never
    thought about this, but sending messages over the network and deciding how
    those messages should be sent are two different things. I merged them in my
    head and had to rethink networking because of it. The wire protocol is how
    TCP or UDP is used to send data back and forth. The contents of that data is
    the messaging protocol.

- Python's dynamic typing was really difficult when the project got larger. I
    couldn't believe the sensation. It was as if as soon as the project got to
    be slightly larger than I could hold in my brain, I literally felt something
    fall out of my working memory and I had to go and find what it was and get
    it back in there.

- ChatGPT as a coding assitant (both more and less useful than people think)
    Took me all of my 11 years of practice and an AI assistant to do this in 13
    days. People think that the usage of AI makes things effortless but in
    reality it took many prompts and 11 years of coding experience to make this
    project. The main advantage I saw to conversational AI was the sheer
    reduction in the need for searching the web. Upon receiving an answer, I
    could then drill down into it by asking follow up questions. This is truly
    the next generation of research.

- Dynamic typing combined with metaprogramming made for a powerful design for
    the event system. However, it was also challenging to debug the project as
    it grew.

## Networking
- Network Design: Messaging Model
- Networking Techniques: TCP and UDP, NAT Punchthrough
- Wire Protocol vs Message Protocol

On the server, connections were tracked by address and handled in their own
task.

## Game Building Blocks
- Entity System and Future Extensions
- Project Prototyping with Free Assets

## Asynchronous Programming
- Creation and Utility of Stoppable Task System
- Python Threading

Asynchrony was harnessed through the creation of a stoppable task type that took
advantage of Python generators to yield at key stopping points in the thread
handler function. Cleanup code could then examine which checkpoint was last
yielded to see what resources needed to be freed. The server transport, client
handler, and client transport all used the task type in order to run code in a
separate thread. All the usual Python threading caveats apply, although a useful
feature of the task class was a built in way to send and receive messages from
outside and inside the task. This provided a very flexible base upon which to
build complex raw socket handling code while utilizing Python's ability to get
parallelism with IO tasks.

## Client-Server Model
- Client Responsibilities
- Server Responsibilities

## Event/Messaging System
- Use of Pydantic and MessagePack
- Quick Update Type and Deduplication

TODO(pbz): Create mermaid diagrams for this stuff.

Both the client and the server made use of a custom networking facility that
used raw TCP sockets. To send structured data back and forth, an event/messaging
model was created by using Pydantic models serialized to JSON and encoded with
MessagePack which greatly reduced their size. Events were effectively type
checked as constructing one with incorrect data types was impossible using
Pydantic.

TODO(pbz): Create mermaid diagrams for this stuff.

Events also took advantage of the mixin class design pattern by inheriting from
a quick update type that would demarcate that event as eligible for
deduplication in situations where the network was unable to keep up with the
amount of those events being sent. This worked extremely well and made it so
that only one player input or entity update event was ever sent over the wire.
Since the events already used Pydantic, adding a new event type was as simple
as inheriting one or two classes and adding annotated fields.

## GameObject Model
- Server and Client Game Object Model
- Object Model Modification and Event Communication

The game object model was maintained by the server and mirrored on the client.
Modifications to the model during runtime were communicated via one-shot or
frame-by-frame events. The map was only update upon modification and the current
position of entities and connected players was sent every frame. The object
model was simple in that there were only ever 3 types, one for the player,
entities, and boxels. More types would have eventually been needed to structure
and store more data, however, as dictionaries formed the backbone of the client
and server's game object storage.

## Graphics and Input
- Rendering with Raylib
- Gamepad Input Management

Input was gathered using Raylib. Gamepad input was extremely easy to obtain and
manage. Graphics were rendered using Raylib.

## 3D Boxel Design
- Designing 3D Boxels with Blender
- Texture Management and Caching

Boxels are designed to support a different texture on each of the 6 sides and be
about the size of one entity in the game. This makes it so that levels can be
created quickly while still feeling big enough. I found that with voxels, each
"volumetric pixel" is too granular and basically requires outdoor areas to make
use of procedural generation.

![Boxel Mesh](../static/img/boxels/boxel-mesh.png)

The 3D boxels themselves were loaded from a mesh created in Blender containing
6 quads made of 2 coplanar triangles, each with UV coordinates mapped to a
spritesheet laid out with room for 6 textures along the X axis. The boxel model
was loaded once but then each unique combination of boxel side textures was
drawn to an image and uploaded to the GPU for use during rendering. In this way,
boxels using the same texture could be batched by Raylib and there was ever only
1 mesh in play aside from the quads submitted by Raylib for billboard sprites,
fonts, and debug geometry. When drawn to an image during runtime, they would
look like this:

![Boxel Texture](../static/img/boxels/boxel-texture.png)

![Boxel Texture Annotated](../static/img/boxels/boxel-texture-annotated.png)

Specifying side textures to cache used these combinations:

* All sides
* Top, rest of sides
* Top, bottom, rest of sides
* Top, bottom, left, right, front, back

A small benefit of this was that if a boxel had the same texture ID for all of
it's sides, only one texture ID would need to be sent over the network when the
map changed.
