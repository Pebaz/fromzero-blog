It's taken me a lot of personal development to get to the point where I could
even finish something I'd call a "game". Boxels is not that. Other than walking
around, there is nothing to iteract with in the gameworld.

For the longest time I worked on "games" only to the point of seeing something
on screen or achieving a particular technical accomplishment and I would table
the project for later.

I created boxels in 13 day's time working in the evenings and weekends for a
total of approximately 30 hours of work.

3D audio took me almost an entire day.
Physics took me an entire day.
Networking took me 3 days and I rewrote it 3 times.
I tried 2 different networking techniques to no avail: a
public rendezvous server for NAT Punchthrough and using TCP and UDP together.

Wire protocol vs message protocol.

* Python, Raylib, and a bunch of other libraries
* From-scratch TCP socket networking
* By-hand 3D audio
* ChatGPT as a coding assitant (both more and less useful than people think)
    Took me all of my 11 years of practice and an AI assistant to do this in 13
    days.
* Python's dynamic typing was really difficult when the project got larger.
    I couldn't believe the sensation. It was as if as soon as the project got to
    be slightly larger than I could hold in my brain, I literally felt something
    fall out of my working memory and I had to go and find what it was and get
    it back in there.
